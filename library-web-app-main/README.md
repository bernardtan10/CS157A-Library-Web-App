# library-web-app
Final project for CS157A  
This is a library catalog web app that is fully coded in Java, making use of servlet and JSP functionality. The program was built in Eclipse Enterprise/Web Development IDE,
and was run and tested on the Apache Tomcat Server Container. 

In order to run this project, you must have Eclipse Enterprise/Web Development and Apache Tomcat downloaded. It is also necessary to download the ojdbc jar file from the Oracle
Jars website. In order to build the project, you can clone the repository, or download the source code as a zip file. From there, you can open it up in Eclipse 
Enterprise/Web Development and run it through the IDE. Another option would be to export the project from Eclipse as a "war" file to the Tomcat server, and then visit the
localhost website to run the project.
